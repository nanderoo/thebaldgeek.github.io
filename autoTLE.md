# A flow to automatically get TLE data from celestrak.com and use it with the satellites node   
   
Navigation: [home](README.md)

There are two parts to consider here.   
You should not hit the URL every time you want to track the satellite or move the rotator. To pull this off, we get the TLE and store it in a flow.context, then every time we want to move the rotator or get the satellite position data we read the TLE out of the flow.context.
    
With all that said, here is the flow:

That looks super ugly. I really don't like markdown.
