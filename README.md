# Using Node-RED to manage ADSC, ADSB, ACARS and other aircraft type messages.

So many message types, so many different message paths and sources.

Pull them all together with Node-RED and put them on a central web dashboard.

### Raspberry Pi or Windows PC or Linux Box?

Begin with the end in mind as my boss used to say. Where you run Node-RED depends on how much you want your system to grow.

###  READ THIS!

My moto is 'fail fast, fail often'. I am NOT a programer. Do NOT use any of the code shown here. These pages and the code on them are for entertainmet use only.

### Support or Contact

I will do my best to support your Node-RED aircraft spotting / tracking adventures, but please keep in mind, I am NOT a programmer. I honestly have no idea or right to be doing any of this, so your milage may vary. Also, since I am not a programmer (Have I mentioned I am not a programmer?), I have no idea what a 'pull request' is or how to deal with one, so if you raise one... yeah, sorry... I can't help.
