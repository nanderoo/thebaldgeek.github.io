# Flows to work with the JSON data provided by VRS (Virtual Radar Server).   
   
Navigation: [home](README.md)  

One of the first things to do is to install a JSON pretty print extension in your web browser of choice. It will make working with the VRS feeds (called receivers) a lot easier to see and drill into.   
Each receiver has a feed ID, you will need that feed ID if you want to drill into your Jaero feeds and use Node-RED to look at the numbers of aircraft each satellite channel is carrying.    
Of course, there is also nothing stopping you from just looking the total of all the feeds and calling it a day.
