# How to build a C-Band ground station.   
   
Navigation: [home](README.md)  

C-Band is the most difficult aspect of a satcom ground station, but because of this and the rich data it can provide, if you have the space, time and patience its probably the most rewarding.   
   
To see what Inmarsat satellite(s) are over your location, review the [Inmarsat](Inmarsat.md) page. This step is critical and not optional for a C-Band setup. You will need a very clear view of the satellite over its entire orbit. It will need to be well above the horizon at all times and it will need to be clear of all terrestrial obstructions at all times.   
You will need the space for a minimum of a 6 foot (2 meter) dish. Some people will tell you that you can get away with a smaller dish, but the signal is going be so marginal that its hard to justify the time and money to setup something might only just work. I also feel that most people will want a large enough dish that all signals from the satellite can be recovered around the clock. If you are close to the equator (ie, under the satellite) then yes, perhaps something smaller might work. Do your research, ask lots of questions from those that insist a smaller dish will 'work just fine'... Moving on.... Having free access to the dish is also important, you will be spending a lot of time working on it and adjusting it for the setup / commissioning period. If it is on a roof where access is uncomfortable or dangerous, that is a no-go in my mind. You will need also run a coax and a few command and control cables to the dish and lastly some sort of power outlet or stable low voltage outlet will be required.
