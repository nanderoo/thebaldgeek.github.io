Navigation: [home](README.md)  

One of, if not, THE first thing you will need to do is find which of the 4 Inmarsat satellites covers your port of the planet. Or even more specifically, which of them is visible from your desired antenna location.    
There are two versions of the following diagram floating around on the Internet, be sure and consult the correct one (the one shown here). One is pre-migration, the other is post-migration. Inmarsat moved the orbits for better coverage and other technical reasons.
