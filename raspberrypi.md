Navigation: [home](README.md)

The Pi can support 3 USB dongles with a good quality power supply. Most people will want to run an ADSB dongle, an ACARS dongle and a VDL2 dongle.   
   
Here is how to set the Pi timezone / clock to UTC:   
First run `sudo raspi-config`  
From the main menu, slect option 5.

## ZeroTeir ##
I access all my remote Pis (and a few Windows PCs needed for Jaero etc) via ZeroTier.com can not speak more highly of it.  
Here is how to quickly install it on a fresh Pi:  
`curl -s https://install.zerotier.com/ | sudo bash`  
`sudo systemctl enable zerotier-one`  
`sudo zerotier-cli status`  
`sudo zerotier-cli join YourZeroTeirNetworkID`  
Authenticate and name this Pi by going to your network on their website.  
`sudo zerotier-cli listnetworks`  
`sudo touch /var/lib/zerotier-one/networks.d/YourZeroTeirNetworkID.conf`
